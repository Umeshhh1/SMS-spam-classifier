# ðŸ“± SMS Classifier

A machine learning-based SMS classifier that can detect whether a message is **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**. This project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction using NLP techniques, and classification using traditional ML models.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham**
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer
- Trained using models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Name:** SMS Spam Collection Dataset
- **Description:** 5,574 SMS messages labeled as either spam or ham.

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression 
- Support Vector Machine
